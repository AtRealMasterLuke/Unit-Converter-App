# Unit-Converter-App
A simple, user-friendly Unit Converter application built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. This app allows users to convert between various units (e.g., length, weight, temperature). The project is a practical exercise in using Jetpack Compose to create modern, declarative UIs in Android development.
# Features
 - Kotlin language with Jetpack Compose for UI design.
 - User input fields using `OutlinedTextField`.
 - Real-time conversion of units.
 - Clean and minimal UI with dynamic elements.
 - Themed with Material3 for a modern look and feel.
# Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:
 1. MainActivity.kt: The main entry point of the app, where the composable functions are called, and the app's UI is structured.
 2. UnitConverter Composable: Contains the UI elements for the unit conversion input and display. Utilizes a `Column` for stacking and a `Row` for side-by-side elements.
# Getting Started
 - Android Studio (latest version recommended)
 - Kotlin 1.5 or higher
 - Jetpack Compose setup
# Usage
Once the app is launched, input values into the provided fields, and the app will automatically calculate and display the converted unit values.
# How It Works (for Developers)
 - The `OutlinedTextField` is used to take user input, while `Row` and `Column` Composables help in organizing the layout.
 - Additional unit conversion logic will be implemented to handle real-time conversions.
# To-Do List
- Add unit conversion logic (e.g., from meters to feet, Celsius to Fahrenheit, etc.)
- Handle different unit categories (length, weight, temperature, etc.)
- Refine UI with appropriate labels and results display
- Add error handling for invalid input
